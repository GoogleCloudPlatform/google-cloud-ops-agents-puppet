# Cloud Operations Puppet Agents Testing

## Overview

This repo leverages the following for integration testing:

- [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute): Test instances
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions): Continuous integration
- [Packer](https://www.packer.io/): Build test instance base images
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/): Deploy test instances
- [Inspec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec): Perform validation

## Google Compute Engine

Google Compute Engine hosts the testing environment, ensure the following APIs are enabled in the project:

```bash
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable storage-api.googleapis.com
```

Create a service account with the following roles:

- Compute Admin
- Service Account User

Create a service account json key, which will be referenced during Github Actions configuration.

## Github Actions

Github actions requires several secrets. Navigate to the repositories secrets and add the following:

- **GCP_PROJECT_ID**: Google Cloud project_id
- **GCP_SA_KEY**: Google Cloud service account json key
- **SSH_PRIVATE_KEY**: keypair private key
- **SSH_PUBLIC_KEY**: keypair public key

#### Keypair

You can generate an SSH keypair with `ssh-keygen`. This keypair will be used for Puppet and Inspec's ssh connectivity.

## Packer

Packer will require access to Google APIs. This [guide provides](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/building/build-vm-images-with-packer) examples on how to setup your working environment.

### Linux

Packer is used to "bake" `puppet` and `gcloud sdk` into base images. Using base images allows tests to be repeatable, reliable, fast.

Base images must be built prior to running tests. Install `packer` and then run the following commands in the `test/packer` directory:
```bash
./build.sh ubuntu-2004-lts
./build.sh ubuntu-1804-lts
./build.sh ubuntu-1604-lts
./build.sh debian-10
./build.sh debian-9
./build.sh centos-s8
./build.sh centos-8
./build.sh centos-7
./build.sh rhel-8
./build.sh rhel-7
./build.sh sles-12
./build.sh sles-15
```

### Windows

Packer is currently not used to build Windows images. Windows images can be built manually with the following steps:
1. Deploy windows 2019 datacenter
2. Install Puppet Agent
   1. Download: `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://downloads.puppetlabs.com/windows/puppet7/puppet-agent-7.3.0-x64.msi -OutFile C:/agent.msi`
   2. Run installer: `C:\agent.msi`
   3. Choose default settings, even for "puppet server". CI will run in serverless mode with `puppet apply`
3. Install Ruby
   1. Download: `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/releases/download/RubyInstaller-3.0.1-1/rubyinstaller-3.0.1-1-x64.exe -OutFile C:/ruby.exe`
   2. Install: `C:\ruby.exe`
   3. Skip ridk install at the end
4. Install r10k
   1. In a new Powershell windows, run: `gem install r10k`
5. Shutdown
6. Create Disk Image
   1. Navigate to Compute Engine --> Storage --> Disks
   2. Select the disk for your instance
   3. Choose "Create Image"
      1. Name it `windows-2019-0`
      2. Set family to `puppet-windows-2019`
      3. Future images can be incremented, `puppet-windows-2019-1` and so on.
   4. Ensure `terraform/main.tf` image mapping is pointing to the correct windows image
7. Add user
   1. Create a local user (not with a microsoft email)
   2. username: `ci`
   3. password: Can be anything. CI will use an ssh key for authentication
   4. Set the account type to administrator
8. Install Powershell Core
   1.  `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.1.3/PowerShell-7.1.3-win-x64.msi -OutFile C:/pw.msi`
   2.  `C:\pw.msi`
       1.  Enable "powershell remoting" during the install
9.  Install SSH For Powershell
   3.  `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases/download/V8.6.0.0p1-Beta/OpenSSH-Win64.zip -OutFile C:/ssh.zip`
   4.  Extract the zip
   5.  Run: `C:\ssh\OpenSSH-Win64\install-sshd.ps1`
   6. Allow ssh through the firewall
      1. Run: `New-NetFirewallRule -Name sshd -DisplayName 'OpenSSH Server (sshd)' -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 22`
   7. Manage the service
      1. `net start sshd`
      2. `Set-Service sshd -StartupType Automatic`
      3. `Set-Service ssh-agent -StartupType Automatic`
      4. `Restart-Service sshd`
   8. administrators_authorized_keys
      1. Run notepad as administrator
      2. Paste your public key (the one used for Github actions). It will look something like this, but much longer. Make sure the username `ci` is appended at the end.
      ```
      ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAAPz5teSUtfo1A6UDbls8EFQRlxEICIgRlUFe8JPVL3QOvpqY7Fit0zRPJXWs7L4b1PHA5+rEUNAl9LUdBzHb/kJjnXepe8qoNRGZZiazd738= ci
      ```
   9. Test SSH, where `-i` points to your public key used for github actions
      1.  `ssh -i id_rsa ci@34.66.152.33`
          1.  You should not be prompted for a password
          2.  Run `puppet help` to verify

## Terraform

Terraform is used by the Github Actions workflow, no setup configuraton is required. The configuration can be found in `test/terraform`.

## Inspec

Inspec is used for running integration tests. Test cases are found in `test/cases`. No setup configuraton is required. 

The directory structure is as follows:

```bash
test/cases/{platform}/{agent_type}/{version}/{action}/
```

For example, ops-agent version 1.04 on linux:
```bash
test/cases/linux/ops-agent/1.0.4/install/
```

Tests with specific versions will:
1. Install the agent
2. Upgrade the agent
3. Uninstall the agent
4. Install the agent with a custom configuration

Inspec output will look like this:
```bash

Profile: tests from test/cases/linux/ops-agent/1.0.4/custom_config/spec/spec.rb (tests from test.cases.linux.ops-agent.1.0.4.custom_config.spec.spec.rb)
