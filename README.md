## Requirements

Permissions to the Google Cloud API. If you are running an old Compute Engine instance or Compute Engine instances created without the default credentials, then you must complete the following steps https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/authorization#before_you_begin.

## Prerequisite Modules

The following modules must be available on the Puppet server:
- [lwf-remote_file](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/lwf/remote_file)

## Install Module

### Install Module from Source
To build the module from source:
- Build: `pdk build`
- Copy to your Puppet server
  - The built module can be found in `pkg/`
- Install: `puppet module install ops-cloud_ops-0.1.0.tar.gz`
- Verify: `puppet module list`

## Usage

| Parameter               | Default       | Description                                                       |
| ---                     | ---           | ---                                                               |
| `agent_type`            | Required      | The agent type: `ops-agent`, `monitoring`, `logging`              |
| `installed`             | `true`        | Boolean value. Ensure that the agent is installed or uninstalled  |
| `version`               | `latest`      | The version variable can be used to specify which version of the agent to install. The allowed values are latest, MAJOR_VERSION.*.* and MAJOR_VERSION.MINOR_VERSION.PATCH_VERSION, which are described in detail below. |
| `main_config`           |               | Optional value for overriding the default configuration           |
| `additional_config_dir` |               | Optional value for overriding the plugins directory for the `monitoring` or `logging` agents |

### Version

- version=`latest`
  - This setting makes it easier to keep the agent version up to date, however it does come with a potential risk. When a new major version is released, the policy may install the latest version of the agent from the new major release, which may introduce breaking changes. For production environments, consider using the version=MAJOR_VERSION.*.* setting below for safer agent deployments.

- version=`MAJOR_VERSION.*.*`
  - When a new major release is out, this setting ensures that only the latest version from the specified major version is installed, which avoids accidentally introducing breaking changes. This is recommended for production environments to ensure safer agent deployments.

- version=`MAJOR_VERSION.MINOR_VERSION.PATCH_VERSION`
  - This setting is not recommended since it prevents upgrades of new versions of the agent that include bug fixes and other improvements.

### Example:

An example implementation can be found in [example/manifests/ops_agent.pp](example/manifests/ops_agent.pp)

#### Ops Agent

Install the latest version:
```ruby
cloud_ops::agent {'ops-agent':
  agent_type  => 'ops-agent',
}
```

#### Ops Agent with Custom Configuration

This example assumes:
- The module's name is `example`
- The module `example` has a file at `files/ops_agent/config.yaml` that represents the custom configuration

Install version 1.0.5 and use a custom configuration:
```ruby
cloud_ops::agent {'ops-agent':
  agent_type  => 'ops-agent',
  installed   => true,
  version     => '1.0.5',
  main_config => 'puppet:///modules/example/ops_agent/config.yaml',
}
```

#### Remove Ops Agent

Ensure the agent is not installed by setting `installed` to false:
```ruby
cloud_ops::agent {'ops-agent':
  agent_type  => 'ops-agent',
  installed   => false,
  version     => 'latest',
}
```

#### Install Monitoring Agent

- Install latest release of major version 6
- Use custom configuration
- Use custom plugins

```ruby
cloud_ops::agent {'monitoring-agent':
  agent_type            => 'monitoring',
  installed             => true,
  version               => '6.*.*',

  # optional
  main_config           => 'puppet:///modules/example/monitoring/collectd.conf',
  additional_config_dir => 'puppet:///modules/example/monitoring/plugins'
}
```

#### Install Logging Agent

- Install latest release
- Use custom configuration
- Use custom plugins

```ruby
cloud_ops::agent {'logging-agent':
  agent_type            => 'logging',
  installed             => true,
  version               => 'latest',

  # optional
  main_config           => 'puppet:///modules/example/logging/google-fluentd.conf',
  additional_config_dir => 'puppet:///modules/example/logging/plugins'
}
```
